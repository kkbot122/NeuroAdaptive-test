"""
Processing job orchestration, invoked by the Celery worker.

The HTTP layer only commits a durable job then dispatches its ID. This service
is deliberately independent of Celery so worker retries and offline tests use
the identical stage/idempotency implementation.

Stages are idempotent: re-running one replaces its own output rather than
appending. That is what makes retry safe.
