"""
Pure candidate scoring. No DB session, no network client, no clock read
anywhere in this module -- every input arrives as a plain value on
LearnerStateSnapshot/Candidate/Context (mandate: "a pure function of
(learner state snapshot, candidate list, context) with no I/O inside it").
This is what makes it unit-testable with fixtures and swappable for a
learned policy later without touching any caller (service.py is the only
caller, and it only does persistence/reads around this function).
