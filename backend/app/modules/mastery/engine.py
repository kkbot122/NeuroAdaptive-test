"""
Pure mastery-update math. No I/O -- no DB session, no network client, no
clock reads other than the `now` argument the caller supplies. This is what
AGENTS.md means by "keep the mastery engine pure and deterministic": the
whole formula is a function of its inputs and can be unit-tested with plain
fixtures, and swapped for a BKT/IRT implementation later without touching any
caller (frozen-scope.md; Phase 3 mandate).

CONFLICT, DECLARED: two governing sources give two different mastery-update
formulas with two different constant sets:
  - docs/adaptation-spec.md Eq.2: m_c(t+1) = (m*w_prior + e_a*w_evidence) /
    (w_prior + w_evidence), w_prior=3.0, w_evidence=1.0.
  - SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md S10 / this phase's own pack ("SDD Deep Dive 4"):
    mastery = (S + m0*k) / (W + k), m0=0.3, k=2, uncertainty = 1/sqrt(1+W).
This phase's own prompt pack is explicit that the SDD's numbers are "what
this phase should implement" and instructs flagging any future attempt to
mix the two constant sets. That is a direct, in-pack resolution of a conflict
between two governing docs, so per AGENTS.md's authority order this
implements the SDD formula (S/W weighted-evidence form) below. The
adaptation-spec.md Eq.2 form is not used anywhere in this module.

Evidence weight itself (w_base * concept_weight * difficulty * hint_penalty *
retry_penalty) is applied at write time and stored per-event
(MasteryEvent.evidence_weight_base); recency decay is applied at READ time
against each event's age, exactly as the pack specifies ("applied AT READ
TIME, not stored") -- so raw evidence history is permanent and auditable,
and current mastery still reflects current (decayed) evidence.
